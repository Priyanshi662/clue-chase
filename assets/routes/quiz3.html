        <p class="story">
            Kris and Lindy Powell are twins who love to play pranks on their family and friends. When they find a ventriloquist dummy in a dumpster, they decide to use it in their act. They name the dummy Slappy and are amazed when he seems to come to life during their performances.
            
            As the story progresses, strange things start happening around the house. Slappy seems to move on his own, and the girls begin to suspect that he might be alive. Their suspicions are confirmed when Slappy attacks their neighbor and tries to strangle their mother.
            
            In the climax of the story, the girls try to get rid of Slappy once and for all. They tie him up and put him in a garbage can, but he manages to escape. When they return home, they find Slappy waiting for them in their bedroom. He attacks them, and they fight back with a fireplace poker.
            
            Just as it seems like they might defeat Slappy, they hear another voice. A second dummy, Mr. Wood, has come to life and is working with Slappy to terrorize the girls. The twins are trapped in their room as the dummies advance, and the story ends on a cliffhanger as they are left to face their fears.
